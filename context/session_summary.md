"OpenSpore has been actively used in this session. First the user asked about the current song on Spotify and instructed OpenSpore to modify the spotify.sh script to add a 'play song' command. After iterating on the script and fixing some bugs, the user verified that the script works as expected. The user then asked OpenSpore to write, install, and execute a new skill which it accomplished by creating a sys_info.sh script. OpenSpore then answered if the watchman service was running. These actions were followed by a read request of the session summary, requested by the user.
