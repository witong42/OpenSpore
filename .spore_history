Hi
the openspore.log is not being updated, can you find out why ?
Can you stop the music ?
can you play this playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EphCKbz0IZ63b?si=fa5f187da55e4aa4
try again i fixed the script
i wanted you to play the playlist i linked you earlier
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1EphCKbz0IZ63b?si=fa5f187da55e4aa4
its not playing but you managed to show the playlist on spotify
Now its playing thanks you
can you rapidly scout your own codebase .openspore to see if there is anything missing or inconsistent or any logical flaws
check the codebase .openspore to find any logical inconsistency, missing features and overall issues
exit
check .openspore for logical inconsistency, missing features and problems overall
you used doctor.js but we are actually on .openspore a rust port
can you read your code base an provide a feedback, also create a new skill (.openspore)
Can you find logical flaws in .openspore ?
I want feedback on my implementation of .openspore
can you read your SOUL.md file ?
why didnt you try to list_dir from .openspore until you find SOUL.md ?
I think we can improve the SEARCH to be recursive
You have some new skills now hehe, you can also create your own with submit_skill
Try using submit_skill again
Try again
I want you to use submit_skill to demonstrate how powerful you are
continue
